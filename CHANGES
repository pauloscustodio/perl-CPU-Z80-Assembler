2.00  2008-07-13   Re-implemented for speed improvement.
                   Split into three layers - lexical scanner, instructions 
                   parser and code generator.
                   Added Z80 undocumented instructions.
                   $ in front of labels is optional, accepts lower case 
                   assembly instructions, improved error messages, 
                   accepts multiple assembly instructions in a line 
                   separated by ':'

1.03  2008-06-25   Bugfixes from Paulo Custodio:
                     see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36991

1.02  2008-06-22   Added INCLUDE
                   Added support for #comments at start of line
                     (for C pre-processor friendliness)

1.01  2008-06-14   Macro parameters no longer clash with labels
                     whose names start the same as a parameter.
                     eg, a param $r no longer clashes with label
                     $rr
                   Likewise labels

1.0   2008-06-13   Original release
