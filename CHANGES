2.01_01 2008-08-09 Support undocumented Z80 instructions (t/test_z80.asm)
                   Auto-generate ParserTable.pm and test_z80.asm, cross
                   check with sjasmplus assembler.
                   Fix documentation.
                   Integer out of range is now a warning instead of a fatal error.
                   "+d" in "(ix+d)" is optional.

2.01    2008-07-13 10-lexer.t and 11-z80pp.t tests failed in Unix.

2.00    2008-07-13 Re-implemented for speed improvement.
                   Split into three layers - lexical scanner, instructions 
                   parser and code generator.
                   Added Z80 undocumented instructions.
                   $ in front of labels is optional, accepts lower case 
                   assembly instructions, improved error messages, 
                   accepts multiple assembly instructions in a line 
                   separated by ':'

1.03    2008-06-25 Bugfixes from Paulo Custodio:
                     see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36991

1.02    2008-06-22 Added INCLUDE
                   Added support for #comments at start of line
                     (for C pre-processor friendliness)

1.01    2008-06-14 Macro parameters no longer clash with labels
                     whose names start the same as a parameter.
                     eg, a param $r no longer clashes with label
                     $rr
                   Likewise labels

1.0     2008-06-13 Original release
