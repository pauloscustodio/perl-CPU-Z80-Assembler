1.02  2008-06-22   Added INCLUDE
                   Added support for #comments at start of line
                     (for C pre-processor friendliness)

1.01  2008-06-14   Macro parameters no longer clash with labels
                     whose names start the same as a parameter.
                     eg, a param $r no longer clashes with label
                     $rr
                   Likewise labels
