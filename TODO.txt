- Accept -I for include path, open file searches in include path
- Join continuation lines (\\\n)
- Test performance of lexer based on Regexp::Assemble
- Compatible with TASM
- perlcritic
- accept $80 and #80 as hex
- accept %01 as binary
X Try to speed up by discarding tokens as they are processed - no need for
  HOP::Stream except for the listing phase, where we can read the input again,
  or keep the list of all read lines in memory.
X Replace all die by error_at for error messages
X Macro processing should be done within the main parsinng table, for speed
- No need to return the "\n" tokens in the macro definition with the new method of listing
  looking at the input files
- List : include line numbers, file names, hex address and bytes, full input source
- List : include list of symbols at the end
X Test all error messages
X More robust error_at - leave last defined token in the stream, error_at receives the 
  stream pointer
X error_at / warning_at : remove, use Line methods instead
- Change JR to JP if distance too far
