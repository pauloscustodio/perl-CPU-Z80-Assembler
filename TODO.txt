- BUGS:
	* RST expr : not accepted

- NEW FEATURES:
	* High Level Assembly
	* XSAccessor

- Differentiate read-only and read-write labels; if label is redefined, check
  consistency with multiple usage before and after each re-definition
- TASM compatibility:
	- .MODULE xxx and local labels starting by '_'
	- .BLOCK / .DEFS - advance instruction pointer
	- .BYTE / DB / DEFB
	- .WORD / DW / DEFW
	- #define macros for text substitution, including "\\\n" continuation lines
	- #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif on defined macros
	- accept #if EXPR, computed at bytes() phase
	- .END label : define start label
	- .EQU / = / .SET to define symbol values
	- .EXPORT directive to export a list of labels to a file that may be 
	  included in another assembly
	- .FILL to fill a number of bytes with a value
	- .ORG may be used to reserve space
	- *= / $= as synonyms to .ORG
	- generate symbol table (command line option)
	- .TEXT for double-quoted strings, that accept escape sequences
	- Single quoted strings - no escape sequences
- Accept -I for include path, open file searches in include path
- Test performance of lexer based on Regexp::Assemble
- perlcritic
- No need to return the "\n" tokens in the macro definition with the new 
  method of listing looking at the input files
- List : include line numbers, file names, hex address and bytes, full 
  input source
- List : include list of symbols at the end
- Disallow label re-definition
- nasm macros
- separate build into object files, libraries, linker
- RST label does not work; maybe alternate RST / CALL, depending on address?
- higher level structures
- Do we need CPU::Z80::Assembler::Line::text()?
